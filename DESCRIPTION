Description: An implementation of an all-in-one function for a wide range of meta-analysis problems. It contains a single function gmeta() that unifies all standard meta-analysis methods and also several newly developed ones under a framework of combining confidence distributions (CDs). Specifically, the package can perform classical p-value combination methods (such as methods of Fisher, Stouffer, Tippett, etc.), fit meta-analysis fixed-effect and random-effects models, and synthesizes 2x2 tables. Furthermore, it can perform robust meta-analysis, which provides protection against model-misspecifications, and limits the impact of any unknown outlying studies. In addition, the package implements two exact meta-analysis methods from synthesizing 2x2 tables with rare events (e.g., zero total event). A plot function to visualize individual and combined CDs through extended forest plots is also available.
